# Bioreaction-Variation Network

**Bioreaction-Variation Network** is a graph neural network (GNN)-based framework designed to infer individual-specific hidden molecular and physiological pathways that may explain interindividual variation in biological responses to physiological stimuli.

This repository provides the full implementation of the architecture, from data embedding and model training to evolutionary inference and path contribution analysis.

## Pipeline Overview

### 1. Embedding of Training Data
`embedding_for_training_data.py`  
‚Üí Creates `.json` files in `temp_json/`.

### 2. Embedding of Input Data
`embedding_for_input_data.py`  
‚Üí Creates identical `.json` files in `input_data/input_temp_json/`.

### 3. JSON to PT Conversion
`temp_json_to_pt_conversion.py`  
‚Üí Converts JSON files to `.pt` files under `pt_data/`.

### 4. Model Training
`learning.py`  
‚Üí Trains the GNN and saves model files and attention visualizations in `gnn_data/`.

### 5. Network Inference
`network_inference.py`  
‚Üí Performs path inference and evolutionary optimization. Outputs are saved in `explor_data/` and `evolution_output/`.

## Pre-trained Model
A pre-trained GNN model developed from previously constructed datasets is available on **Google Cloud Storage** at the following location:

üìÅ [skeletal_muscle/](https://storage.googleapis.com/skeletal_muscle/sm_v1/)

These folders contain the complete set of files required to perform the domain-specific inference.

**To access previous versions** of the pre-trained model, please replace the current version name (e.g., sm_v1) in the URL with the desired version name.

Each version is organized under its own subdirectory and includes the full set of model, embedding, and metadata files.

### Downloadable Files
Note: To download individual files, append the corresponding subdirectory and file name to the domain-specific URL.
